								<!-- <h2>Tempus veroeros</h2>>-->
								<p>In my previous role, I had the opportunity to work extensively with various technologies and
									 frameworks to develop a mobile app. This included using Kotlin, Android OS, SwiftUI, Dagger Hilt, 
									 Coroutine, Pod, MVVM Retrofit, and more. These tools allowed me to create a robust and user-friendly
									  application for both iOS and Android platforms. I was responsible for implementing features such 
									  as Simbinding, KYC, Payment, Scanning Merchant and Person QR, as well as ensuring seamless user 
									  experience and adherence to authentication guidelines provided by RBI. Additionally, I worked with
									   REST APIs to retrieve and display data from databases, utilizing tools like POSTMAN and Chucker 
									   to manage API calls. Through optimization techniques, I was able to improve the app's performance,
									    user experience, and speed by an impressive 45%. Continuous integration and development were 
										facilitated through GitHub Action, ensuring efficient collaboration and version control.</p>

										<p>In a specific project, I also integrated Cashfree payment services into an iOS app.
											 This involved integrating Cashfree's SDK and implementing the necessary functionalities
											  to enable secure and reliable payment transactions within the app. By leveraging the
											   provided APIs and following the required guidelines, I successfully integrated the 
											   Cashfree payment system, ensuring a seamless payment experience for users.</p>

											   <p>Overall, my experience encompasses a wide range of mobile app development technologies, frameworks, and practices. 
												I have a strong understanding of REST APIs, continuous integration, and version control using Git.
												 I have a proven track record of enhancing app performance, optimizing user experience, and successfully 
												 integrating third-party payment systems.</p>

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>As an Android app developer at Terrafin Solution Pvt Ltd, I thrive on ambition and passion. Deadlines ignite a fire within me, and coding is my way of channeling that energy. I start each day with a focus on productivity, constantly pushing myself beyond limitations and boundaries. Whether it's sports, academics, bike riding, or dancing, I strive to make my presence count in every aspect of my life. In my third year, I even qualified for GATE while also representing my state in basketball. For me, success is not just about achieving high scores; it's about realizing my full potential and making my dreams a reality. I am determined to leave a lasting impact and give my name its true worth.</p>
